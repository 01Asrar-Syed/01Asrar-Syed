# About Me:
Hi! My name is Asrar Syed, presently a student at GSU studying Computer Science.

I am at the start of my programming journey, so I'm planning on utilizing GitHub to collaborate with like-minded learners to advance my knowledge and skills for my future career goals.

I am currently working to master Python(my first programming language) as some of my interests consist of A.I. and Data Science.
